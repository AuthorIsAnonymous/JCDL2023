25085584,26040767,Retracted:A role of MMP-14 in the regulation of invasiveness of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,No,No,"The human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family is comprised of 24 zinc-containing enzymes that share several functional domains. MMPs are the most important proteinases that digest and breakdown extracellular matrix [8–21]*. MMP- 14 is a member of MMP family, and MMP-14 is encoded by a single-copy gene located on chromosome 14 in humans [22].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,6/5/2015,Retracted,,,,,,
