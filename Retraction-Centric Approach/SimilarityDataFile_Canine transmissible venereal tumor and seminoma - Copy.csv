24557542,,Primary Ocular Transmissible Venereal Tumor in a Prepubescent Female Dog,No,No,"The most cited treatment is chemotherapy with vincristine sulfate [6,17,24,27,32]. However, depending on the extent and size of tumor, affected area, relapses or therapeutic failure, a combination of chemotherapeutic agents [4,15]*, surgical excision [24], electrochemotherapy [23] or immunomodulators [9,26,30] can be used.",Introduction,Recommending,No,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.797783,0.556916,0.6773495
24557542,,"Transmissible Cancer: A Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumor during Pregnancy, Case Report",No,No,"Nonetheless, due to the localization and CTVT characteristics the best option would be a caesarean section with the subsequent formula feeding of the puppies [19] (Figure 2). Whether it is the first or the second situation, surgery followed by hysterectomy with salpingo-oopherectomy or caesarean section is not recommended due to the high probability of recurrency [21].",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.72573435,0.6154163,0.670575325
24557542,,Cryosurgery and electrocautery in treatment of transmissible venereal tumours in large breed dogs: a case report,No,No,"Chemotherapy is the most effective TVT treatment (MacEwen 2001), and vincristine is frequently the agent of choice (MacEwen 2001). When tumours do not respond to vincristine, a combination with other agents such as l-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin can yield satisfactory results (Kim et al. 1996; Pansawut et al. 2012; Javanbakht et al. 2014)*. However, single-agent therapy with two to five treatments of vincristine (0.025 mg/kg) at weekly intervals is the most effective treatment (Amber et al. 1990).",Discussion and Conclusion,Recommending,No,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.7157936,0.5622279,0.63901075
24557542,,"The origin, dynamics, and molecular evolution of transmissible cancers",No,No,"CTVT metastasis is not common in healthy dogs, occurring in only 5%–17% of cases.35 However, in immunocompromised animals36 and puppies,37 a higher rate of metastasis is observed. CTVT treatment options include chemotherapy,22,38,39* radiotherapy,40 and surgical excision.41 Chemotherapy using vincristine is regarded to be the most successful and practical therapy.",Other,NotHarmful,No,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.63220525,0.5992266,0.615715925
24557542,,Assessment of tumor-induced pain and C-reactive protein levels in dogs with caninetransmissible venereal tumors,No,No,"Most commonly it is transmitted through sexual intercourse but it could also transmitted through licking, sniffing, and biting of tumoraffected areas (4). Venereal tumors are mostly localized and grossly seen as single or multiple, large or small, soft or friable, pedunculated, nodular, or papillary and tubular masses (5)*.",Introduction,NotHarmful,Yes,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.5581328,0.4576313,0.50788205
24557542,25315185,Retracted: Diagnostic procedures for improving of the KIT (CD117) expressed allele burden for the liver metastases from uterus mast cell tumors: prognostic value of the metastatic pattern and tumor biology,Yes,No,"On the other hand, the results of this study suggest that cellular proliferation plays a significant role in the progression of canine MCTs. Although the results of this study confirm the results of previous studies that have shown the prognostic significance of cellular proliferation in canine MCTs [17, 49–54]*, cellular proliferation should not be evaluated as a single prognostic factor for canine MCTs but should be evaluated in tandem with additional prognostic indicators. Furthermore, the histologic characteristics of the MCT cells in these affected dogs were moderate to abundant cytoplasm, round nuclei with scattered chromatin, fibrous stroma, and eosinophil infiltration.

Also, Amir et al., 2004a and Javanbakht et al., 2014* stated that low incidence of tumors and abscess formation (0.1 % in their study) raised the question, respectively [36, 37]*.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2014,8/22/2014,Retracted,,,
