Its inactivation in the great majority of pancreatic cancers promotes cell proliferation and synergizes with Kras mutations to promote pancreatic carcinogenesis [72]*. Dysfunctioning p16INK4A/CDK4/Cyclin D/Rb axis may still be regulated by PPARγ which is a transcriptional repressor of Cyclin D. 2:In addition, NF-κB lies downstream of activated K-ras and as a result, it may be activated secondary to diverse signals in pancreatic cancer. These signals not only favor carcinogenesis but also perpetuate the inflammatory environment [72, 91]*. NF-κB signaling results in phosphorylation of histone H3 in the promoter of Notch target gene and transcriptional repressor Hes (Hairy and Enhancer of Split) and through this modification cooperates with Notch in upregulation of Hes [92].

Our previous study has shown that activation of Notch and NF-κB were involved in the development of PDAC in the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deϐicient transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2011a)*. Recently, we found over-expression of several miRNAs, such as miR-21, miR-221, miR-27, and miR-155, and down-regulation in the expression of multiple miRNAs including miR-216a, miR-216b, miR-217, and miR-146a in tumors derived from the compound K-Ras and Ink4a/Arf deϐicient transgenic mice (Ali et al., 2011). 2:The LSL-K-Ras strain was bred to the following strains: Pdx1-Cre, INK4a/Arf as previously described (Wang et al., 2011a)*.
