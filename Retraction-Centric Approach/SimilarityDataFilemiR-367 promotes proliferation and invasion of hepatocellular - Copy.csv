26772880,31402560,miR-367 as a therapeutic target in stem-like cells from embryonal central nervous system tumors,No,No,"These in vivo findings highlight miR-367 as a candidate therapeutic target for treating aggressive embryonal CNS tumors since, in this experimental model, tumors were initiated by OCT4A-overexpressing cells, which have been previously shown to generate highly aggressive and infiltrative tumors associated with early onset of clinical manifestations and short survival rates (da Silva et al., 2017). Similar therapeutic approaches could be applicable for other types of cancer in which miR-367 expression has also been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and invasion, such as melanoma (Long et al., 2018), osteosarcoma (Cai et al., 2017), as well as endometrial (Ma et al., 2018), renal cell (Ding et al., 2017), and hepatocellular (Meng et al., 2016)* carcinomas.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Mol Oncol,2019,8/13/2019,NotRetracted,0.886504,0.85185516,0.86917958
26772880,28429344,Up-regulation of microRNA-367 promotes liver steatosis through repressing TBL1 in obese mice,No,No,"Thirdly, luciferase reporter assays and Western blots were used to show that miR-367 has a direct contact with the 3’-UTR of TBL1, by which miR-367 affects PPARa signaling and fatty acid oxidation. Notably, a recent work14* reported that miR-367 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation by negatively regulates its target gene PTEN. Besides, the expression of miR-367 and PTEN are significantly inverses correlated in HCC patients14*. Given that fatty liver has been linked to the development of HCC15,16, we speculate that up-regulation of miR-367 in obese livers might be a causal factor to promote HCC initiation and/or progression.",Discussion,NotHarmful,Yes,>1,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2017,4/22/2017,NotRetracted,0.8572525,0.8606019,0.8589272
26772880,32186712,Adaptive multi-source multi-view latent feature learning for inferring potential disease-associated miRNAs,No,No,"The majority of wellcharacterized miRNAs have indicated their significant roles in many human complex diseases or tumors, such as lung neoplasms, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer and so on [6, 7]. For example, miR-367 is observed to promote hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and show aberrant expressions in hepatocellular cancer patient tumor samples or tissues than that in normal tissues [8]*. Therefore, identifying the underlying relationships between miRNAs and diseases will undoubtedly facilitate the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and contribute to the development of personalized treatment.

26772880,34522450,Exosome encapsulated ncRNAs in the development of HCC: potential circulatory biomarkers and clinical therapeutic targets,No,No," The overexpression of miR-222 in HCC may enhance the metastasis of HCC by activating the AKT signaling pathway [51]. Overexpressed miR-367 inhibits PTEN and enhances the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells [52]*. In addition, overexpression of miR-18a inhibits the downstream molecule Bcl2L10.",Introduction,NotHarmful,Yes,1,Am J Cancer Res,2021,9/15/2021,NotRetracted,0.8566329,0.811704,0.83416845
26772880,28968973,MiR-367 regulates cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting metastasis-associated protein 3 (MTA3) in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma,No,No,"Nishikawa et al. clarify that tumor-suppressive miRNA-29s directly target LOXL2 inhibiting renal cell carcinoma progression [9]. In addition, researchers manifest that miR-367 elevation leads to poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer [10-11], accelerates breast cancer progression by binding with the 3′UTR of the calcium channel ryanodine receptor gene 3 (RYR3) [12] and promotes proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cell [13]*.

26772880,28656290,miR-367 promotes tumor growth by inhibiting FBXW7 in NSCLC,No,No,"Previous studies have mainly investigated the functions of miR-367 in embryonic stem cell self-renewal and the maintain of pluripotency (4). Recent studies revealed that miR-367 participates in the tumorigenesis of various types of cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (5)*, medulloblastoma (6) and pancreatic cancer (7). In contrast, in the study of gastric carcinoma, miR-367 inhibited cell migration and invasion, and its expression in cancer tissues was much lower than that in normal stomach tissues (8).

26772880,31541003,Retracted: MicroRNA-367 promotes progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through PTEN /PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,No,No,"1: Meng et al. reported that the expression level of miR-367 was positively correlated with malignant proliferation and invasion of HCC cells [24]*. Up-regulation of miR-367 predicted aggressive HCC progression, and its knockdown could suppress the malignant behaviors of the cancer cells that miR-367 might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC. 2:Thus, we calculated that miR-367 targeted PTEN in HCC, and PTEN was located at the down-stream of miR-367. Meng et al. reported that miR-367 could negatively regulate PTEN in HCC [24]*. Their study supported our results. However, Xu et al. suggested that miR-367 might bind to 3’UTR of MDM2, thus contributing to metastasis of HCC [25].",Discussion,NotHarmful,Yes,>1,Biosci Rep,2019,9/22/2019,Retracted,,,
