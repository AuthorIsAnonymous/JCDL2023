17255935,23056166,"Myb-binding protein 1A (MYBBP1A) is essential for early embryonic development, controls cell cycle and mitosis, and acts as a tumor suppressor",No,No,"MYBBP1A also binds the developmentally essential Prep1 homeodomain transcription factor and inhibits its activity by competing with its DNA-binding partner Pbx1 [4]. MYBBP1A is also a component of the Ret–CoR co-repressor complex [8]*. In contrast to these inhibitory activities, MYBBP1A binds to and stimulates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) [9].",Other,NotHarmful,Yes,1,PLoS One,2012,10/12/2012,NotRetracted,0.70058286,0.7749229,0.7068128,0.5512304,0.83368564,0.88446224,0.741949473
17255935,22333916,Epigenetic silencing of myogenic gene program by Myb-binding protein 1a suppresses myogenesis,No,No,"1:These findings are highly suggestive of a context-dependent co-repressor function of Mybbp1a in RNA Pol II transcription. In further support of this putative role, Mybbp1a was recently identified as a component of several co-repressor and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, including Ret-CoR and esBAF complex [10,11]*, that mostly contain common constituents such as HDACs. While the roles of Mybbp1a in these repressor complexes remain unclear, it may likely serve similar epigenetic and cellular functions. 2:We sought to further dissect the molecular basis of Mybbp1a’s inhibitory role in rDNA gene transcription. Given the requirement of HDACs in maintaining an inactive state of rDNA promoters [26,30], and the reported association of Mybbp1a with several HDACs-containing co-repressor complexes [10]*, we next aimed to assess whether HDACs contribute to Mybbp1a-mediated rDNA gene silencing. Toward this end, we first performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay and verified that there was an interaction of HDAC1 and HDAC2 with the exogeneous (Myc-Mybbp1a) or endougenous Mybbp1a (Figure 5A, and data not shown). 3:Mybbp1a is known to associate with diverse transcriptional regulators, acting largely as a repressor for Pol II transcription. In this capacity, Mybbp1a was recently identified as a component of several HDAC-containing co-repressor and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, including Ret-CoR and esBAF complex [10,11].

17255935,23098562,In pursuit of synthetic modulators for the orphan retina-specific nuclear receptor NR2E3,No,No,"1:In the absence of ligands, many NRs interact with transcriptional corepressors such as SMRT and NCOR,24,25 while binding of an agonistic ligand induces conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of a NR and dissociation of the corepressor complex. It has been shown that apoNR2E3 is capable of interacting with corepressors NCOR, SMRT, and RetCOR,22,26* and similar to classic NRs such as TRb, RARa, and VDR, can function as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of a ligand.7,22 Here, we describe the development and optimization of the cell-free HTScompatible time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TRFRET) assay for small-molecule NR2E3 agonists, which is based on agonist-induced disruption of the interaction between 2 purified proteins, full-length GST-tagged apoNR2E3 and MBP-tagged fragment of transcriptional corepressor RetCOR (Fig. 1). 2:Historically, screening assays for smallmolecule modulators of nuclear hormone receptors are often based on ligand-sensitive interaction with transcriptional coactivators and corepressors.31–33 It has been shown that apo-NR2E3 is capable of interacting with corepressors N-CoR, SMRT, and RetCOR.22,26* Given that NR–corepressor interaction is agonist sensitive for the vast majority of NRs, we developed a cell-free HTS-compatible TR-FRET assay for small-molecule NR2E3 modulators, which is based on agonist-induced disruption of the interaction between GSTtagged apo-NR2E3 and MBP-tagged fragment of transcriptional corepressor RetCOR (Fig. 1).

17255935,17662965,Regulation of photoreceptor gene expression by Crx-associated transcription factor network,No,No,"1:Similar to other members of the Tlx nuclear receptor family, Nr2e3 has a zinc-finger DNA-binding domain near the N-terminus and a ligand-binding domain in the C-terminus for a ligand yet to be identified [(Kobayashi et al., 1999); Figure 1]. Nr2e3 is expressed in retinal photoreceptor cells beginning around E18 in the mouse, peaking during rod differentiation and persisting into adulthood at a decreased level (Kobayashi et al., 1999; Takezawa et al., 2007)*. Expression appears primarily localized to the outer nuclear layer (Kobayashi et al., 1999; Haider et al., 2000; Haider et al., 2001). 2:An Nr2e1 null mutation also results in enhanced S-cone syndrome in mice (Zhang et al., 2006).

Moreover, PNR binds to and represses the promoter of cyclin D1, which promotes G1/S progression and cell proliferation, implying that wild-type PNR attenuates proliferation of S-cone cells from retinal progenitor cells (42)*. 2:Furthermore, the benefits of PNR-based cancer therapies may extend beyond activating p53, since, in addition to affecting p53 cells, we have found that PNR also induces apoptosis of p53/ HCT116 cells (Fig. 3D and E).

As described in the previous paper, we suppose that the Ret-CoR corepressor complex is formed in a specific phase of the cell cycle and that it functions in a specific stage of development (45)*.

The role of chromatin-remodelling complexes in the alteration of chromatin structure over much of the cell cycle has been studied (Baumann et al, 2007; Groth et al, 2007). 2:To investigate whether the transactivation function of activated ERα varies across the cell cycle, we tested the transactivation function of endogenous ERα activated by 17β-oestradiol (E2) in synchronized MCF7 (ERα-positive) or MDA-MB231 cells (ERα-negative breast carcinoma cell line; Fig 1A; supplementary Fig S1 online). The synchronization of each phase was confirmed by DNA content analysis using flow cytometry, as reported previously (Takezawa et al, 2007)*. In a luciferase assay with an ERE-TATA reporter (a PEST sequence was tagged to luciferase for rapid protein degradation (Hill et al, 2001)), the transcriptional activity of ERα seemed to be unaltered at G1/S (Fig 1B, compare lane 4 with lane 2 in asynchronous cells), whereas at G2/M, its activity was significantly lower in MCF7 cells. 3:A switching factor seems to associate, at least transiently, with these complexes and is presumably functional at speciϐic cell-cycle stages. The appearance of such a factor might be under cell-cycle regulation, similar to a recently characterized cell-cycle-dependent co-repressor (Ret-CoR) that represses the constitutively transrepressive-type nuclear receptor (Takezawa et al, 2007)*. 4: Cells were synchronized 24 h after spreading (for suspension culture, at a cell density of 2 × 10 /ml) by treatment with 2.5 mM thymidine (Wako, Osaka, Japan) at G1/S phase or 10 ng/ml demecolcine (Wako) at G2/M phase under phenol red-free DMEM containing 5% serum.

FLAG-PNR exhibited nuclear localization by immunofluorescence using an α-FLAG antibody, in conforming to its role as a transcriptional factor (Figure 1b).4,16–19* Further, we found that PNR overexpression did not alter the cell morphology of MDA-MB-231 and LM2 cell lines (Figure 1c), nor did it significantly affect cell proliferation in vitro (Figure 1d). 2:As a nuclear receptor, PNR regulates gene expression by directly binding to the promoter region of target genes including cyclin D1 and TBX2 in Y79 retinoblastoma cell line19* and ERα in MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines, respectively.4 As IL-13Rα2 mRNA is increased by PNR overexpression, we hypothesized that PNR may regulate IL-13Rα2 mRNA stability or regulate IL-13Rα2 gene expression by direct association with the IL-13Rα2 promoter.

These include the cell-cycle checkpoint protein human homolog of RAD9 [27]; the NR2E3 co-repressor and RNA helicase DHX30 (RetCoR) [28]*; the HDAC-associated protein NCOR2 (SMRT) [29]; and Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (NRIP1; RIP140) [30]. Interestingly, we found that six out of 14 NRIP1-derived peptides representing different motifs in the array showed significant interaction with FLAG-NR2ELBD (Fig. 2). 2:Interestingly, the expression of the Prox1 homolog in Drosophila, prospero, is regulated by the homolog of NR2E1, Tlx [51], suggesting a role for NR2E1 in controlling PROX1 biological output. Another interactor in the array that is also a neural precursor-related protein is DHX30 (RetCoR), which is important for mediating NR2E3 repressor function in retinal progenitor cells [28]*.",Result and Discussion,NotHarmful,Yes,>1,BMC Genomics,2016,10/27/2016,NotRetracted,,,,,,,

The high clinical variability of NR2E3-linked retinal degenerations suggested different potential disease mechanisms, including absence of NR2E3 protein (Haider, et al., 2000), absence of DNA-binding (Kanda and Swaroop, 2009; Roduit, et al., 2009) or impaired corepressor binding (Escher, et al., 2009; Takezawa, et al., 2007)*.2:Additionally, for these two variants, dimerization was impaired in presence of NR2E3 wildtype and variant proteins, but all reported heterozygous carriers are healthy (Schorderet and Escher, 2009). Impaired binding to the corepressors Ret-CoR (Takezawa, et al., 2007)* or atrophin-1 (Escher, et al., 2009) had been suggested as a disease mechanism for the p.R311Q variant, and additional BRET2 analysis could contribute to substantiate this hypothesis.",Introduction and Discussion,NotHarmful,No,>1,Hum Mutat,2015,2/24/2015,NotRetracted,,,,,,,
17255935,25691470,Structural basis for corepressor assembly by the orphan nuclear receptor TLX,No,No,"However, these studies could not provide insight into the molecular basis for ligand-independent repression by the repressor class of orphan nuclear receptors because they do not rely on the traditional nuclear receptor corepressors NCoR and SMRT to drive gene inhibition. Rather, they recruit other types of corepressors to execute their repressive activity (Bavner et al. 2002; Boulias and Talianidis 2004; Wang et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2006; Sanyal et al. 2007; Takezawa et al. 2007; Yokoyama et al. 2008)*.

PNR activates rod-specific gene expression and suppresses cone-specific gene expression by down-regulating cyclin D1 and TBX2 [16-20]*.This gene regulation pattern defines the dual role of PNR in mediating the development and maintenance of photoreceptors [21]. 2:PNR specific agonists, either natural or synthetic, have been identified using high throughput screening assays. Because apo-PNR has been shown to interact with co-repressors NCOR, SMRT, and RetCoR [20,30]*, the synthetic PNR agonist compound 11a was identified using a GAL4 DNA binding domain-PNR ligand binding domain fusion β-lactamase transactivation assay and NCOR release assay [30,31].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,PLoS One,2013,9/26/2013,NotRetracted,,,,,,,
