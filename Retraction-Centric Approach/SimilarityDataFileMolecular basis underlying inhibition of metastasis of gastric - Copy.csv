24850176,26232914,MiR-153 regulates metastases of gastric cancer through Snail,No,No,"Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancerrelated death in China [1–4]. So far, surgical removal of the stomach that bares the primary tumor remains the most effective treatment, whereas less than half of GC patients are diagnosed at early stages and amenable to potentially curative surgical therapy [1–4]. Moreover, patients who have undergone radical tumor resection have a high rate of relapse, resulting in a pretty low 5-year survival rate [1–4]. Besides multiple genetic and epigenetic changes of protein coding genes in GC, growing evidence indicates that deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) can also contribute to GC development by influencing cell growth, apoptosis, migration, or invasion [1–8].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,8/3/2015,NotRetracted,0.99922967,1,0.826125,0.94178489
24850176,26711782,MiR-130b inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells via CYLD,No,No,"Human brain gastric cancer has high morbidity and mortality. The therapy strategy for gastric cancer included surgical operation, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and biological therapy [1–4]. Surgical operation is the key preference, while radiation therapy and chemotherapy following surgical excision are supplementary therapies to prevent recurrence and metastasis of gastric cancer [1–4]. Nevertheless, the aforementioned therapies are only effective for about half of gastric cancer patients. The prognosis of the other half of the gastric cancer patients is poor, largely due to the malignant growth and invasion of cancer.",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2016,12/30/2015,NotRetracted,0.87625676,0.87789583,0.7612008,0.83845113

24850176,26298723,miR-132 upregulation promotes gastric cancer cell growth through suppression of FoxO1 translation,No,No,"Gastric carcinoma (GC) is among the most frequently diagnosed malignant cancers worldwide and is highly lethal due to its fast growth [1–7]. Currently, surgical removal of the stomachs that bare primary cancer is still the first choice for GC treatment, although the overall outcome remains unsatisfactory [8–11]. It is noteworthy that treatments to suppress GC cell growth may be applied together with surgery and chemotherapy, e.g., 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [12–16], to improve the results. However, such a practical approach is so far much lacking.",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,8/24/2015,NotRetracted,0.8358906,0.83366805,0.6995954,0.789718017
24850176,25971581,Promyelocytic leukemia protein enhances apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through Yes-associated protein,No,No,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a frequently occurring malignant human cancer, which causes about a million yearly deaths [1–4]. Although efforts in the past have significantly improved our understanding of the carcinogenesis as well as the molecular control of tumor growth of GC, this knowledge is far from complete and requires further approaches for establishing innovative therapy [1–8].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,5/15/2015,NotRetracted,0.8324882,0.83015525,0.7443297,0.802324383

24850176,26209295,Fluorouracil induces autophagy-related gastric carcinoma cell death through Beclin-1 upregulation by miR-30 suppression,No,No,"Regionally, the highest incidence of GC rests in Eastern Asia [1–7]. Currently, surgical treatment is the main therapy of GC, although the outcome of the treatment is far from satisfaction [8–11]. Chemotherapy, especially fluorouracil (5-FU), is used as a supplementary treatment for GC and has resulted in better survival of the patients [12–16].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,7/26/2015,NotRetracted,0.81029904,0.810935,0.6611258,0.760786613
24850176,25355597,TGFβ signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,Yes,No,"The predominant isoform, VEGF165, appears to have the highest bioavailability and biological potency and exhibits only partial binding to the cell surface and extracellular matrix. VEGF-A-mediated increase in angiogenesis of PDAC and other tumors has been shown to be critical for cancer growth and metastasis [21–25], while its regulation by the TGFβ receptor signaling pathway in PDAC has been rarely addressed before [26].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,10/31/2014,NotRetracted,0.70884526,0.70700073,0.52315223,0.64633274
24850176,33669066,Syndecans and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,No,No,"MMPs are regulated at many levels, including at the mRNA and protein level (this last one by activation of the proenzyme to its active form), but also by growth factors. For example, VEGF-A downregulation promotes a decrease in MMP-2 expression [72], while the presence of Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF) upregulates MMP-1 and MMP-9 transcripts [73]. However, the most important regulators of MMPs are the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which coexist in balance with MMPs.",Other,NotHarmful,Yes,1,Biomolecules,2021,3/6/2021,NotRetracted,0.62443626,0.6159016,0.42690128,0.55574638
24850176,28413031,Matrix Metalloproteinases in Remodeling of Lower Extremity Veins and Chronic Venous Disease,No,No,"1: MT1-MMP may stimulate the release of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and promote the maturation of osteoblasts (Karsdal et al., 2002). Also, upregulation of MMP-2 increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa), whereas downregulation of MMP-2 decreases VEGFa expression in human gastric cancer cell line SNU-5 (Mao et al., 2014)*. MMP-induced release of growth factors may involve cleaving the growth factor–binding proteins or matrix molecules, and may partly explain the VSMC proliferation observed in hypertrophic regions of VVs (Zhang et al., 2004). 2: Although MMPs stimulate growth factor release, MMPs may be regulated by growth factors (Hollborn et al., 2007). For example, overexpression of VEGFa in SNU-5 cells increases MMP-2 expression, whereas downregulation of VEGFa decreases MMP-2 expression (Mao et al., 2014). Also, platelet-derived growth factor-BB increases MMP-2 expression in rat VSMCs, possibly via Rho-associated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Cui et al., 2014).",Other,NotHarmful,Yes,>1,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,2017,4/18/2017,NotRetracted,0.6135862,0.6066539,0.3756708,0.5319703

24850176,26289848,YT521 promotes metastases of endometrial cancer by differential splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor A,No,No,"The invasion of cancer cells substantially requires cancerassociated neovascularization. Cancer cells themselves or through contacted mesenchymal cells or inflammatory cells release potent angiogenic factors, e.g., fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), angiopoietins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and members from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, to promote cancer invasion and extensive growth [2–10].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,8/21/2015,NotRetracted,0.5818186,0.5755938,0.39294317,0.51678519

For example, overexpression of VEGFa in SNU-5 cells increases MMP-2 expression, while downregulation of VEGFa decreases MMP-2 expression (Mao et al.,2014). Also, platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) increases MMP-2 expression in rat VSMCs, possibly via Rho-associated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Cuiet al., 2014).",Other,NotHarmful,Yes,1,Adv Pharmacol,2018,1/10/2018,NotRetracted,0.5159898,0.5086134,0.30533332,0.443312173
