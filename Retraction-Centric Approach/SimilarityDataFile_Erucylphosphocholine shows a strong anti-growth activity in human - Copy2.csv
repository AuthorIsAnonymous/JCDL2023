18790523,23673723,Interactions of alkylphosphocholines with model membranes-the Langmuir monolayer study,No,No,"These membrane-targeted drugs, before affecting vital functions inside the cell-such as cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, invasion and angiogenesis (Takai et al. 2008)* have to penetrate through the biomembrane. So far, little is known about how APCs interact with membrane constituents. ",Introduction,NotHarmful,Yes,1,J Membr Biol,2013,5/16/2013,NotRetracted,0.5939426,0.5952599,0.7921258,0.660442767
18790523,22424119,Targeting of polo-like kinases and their cross talk with Aurora kinases--possible therapeutic strategies in human acute myeloid leukemia?,No,No,"Several PLK inhibitors have been identified, especially PLK1 inhibitors [45], including the small molecules scytonemin, BI2536, thiophene benzimidazole compound 1, pyrimidine derivative DAP-81, ON01910, TAL, GW843682X, erucylphosphocholine, thiophene benzamidazole, p16INK4a and LFM-A13 (Tables 3 and 5 for detailed information and additional references) [58-70]. Some of these drugs have been studied only in experimental models and may have mainly indirect effects on the cell cycle machinery, for example, erucylphosphocholine that is a membrane-targeted, lipophilic ether lipid of synthetic phospholipid analog that induces apoptosis in certain human tumor cell lines [71]. The antimalarial drug chloroquine also seems to affect the PLK1 protein level and activity in cancer cells [72], and PLKs can also be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin [73].

These compounds exhibit inhibitory capacity against tumour cells derived from different malignant localisations, such as breast [10] and ovarian [11,12]* cancer.

18790523,24628235,Apoptosis induction by erucylphosphohomocholine via the 18 kDa mitochondrial translocator protein: implications for cancer treatment,No,No,"In contrast to the strong cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against a multitude of tumor cell lines, there is an apparent lack of cytotoxicity of ErPC / ErPC3 on nonmalignant cells [8, 25, 50, 57, 58]*. Most importantly, no bone marrow toxicity induced by APCs has been observed in vivo.
