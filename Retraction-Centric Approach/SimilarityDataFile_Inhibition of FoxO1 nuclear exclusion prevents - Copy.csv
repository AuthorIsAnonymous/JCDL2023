Complex treatments combining neurosurgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy only result in extremely poor outcome in patients, with a typical life expectation of less than 1 year [1–3]. 2:Since the tumor locates in the brain, which provides a limited space for tumor expansion due to the restriction of cranium, the outgrowth of GBM is extremely severe [1–3].

Although the growth of the tumor cells in a relatively closed space due to the restriction of cranium may partially account for its malignancy, highly invasive nature of glioblastoma cells has been suggested to be the main reason for the failure of current combined therapies with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery [1–4]. 2:In contrast to most other tissues, there is significantly less ECM in the extracellular milieu of the brain [5]. Hence, ECM could be easily destroyed by modest levels of MMPs. Accumulating evidence has suggested a strong correlation between brain tumor malignancy and MMP activity level [1–4].

However, correlation of EGFR expression and molecules that control OS metastasis has not been drawn. Some therapies have been developed aiming to interfere with intracellular pathways regulated by EGFR in glioblastoma [12–14]*, in lung cancer [15], in larynx carcinoma [16], and in gastric cancer [17].

24771221,28774834,Role of Forkhead Box Class O proteins in cancer progression and metastasis,No,No,"1:In contrast, Ko et al. claimed that loss of FoxO1 promotes the growth of gastric cancers including SNU-638, MKN45, SNU-216 and NCI-N87 cells and metastasis by upregulation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [68]. Also, Chen et al. suggested that activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream PI3 K/Akt induce FoxO1 nuclear exclusion and MMP9 to promote invasion in A-172 glioblastoma cells [69]*. Likewise, Ding et al. also revealed that nuclear exclusion of Akt downstream FoxO1 by EGF-mediated Akt activation enhanced invasiveness via MMP7 activation in Hep-2 larynx carcinoma cells, which was inhibited by EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or by the PI3 K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 [70]. 2:Emerging evidences reveal that Src is overexpressed in the aggressive cancer cells [91,92] through the metastatic cascades via downregulation of cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and upregulation of MMPs [69,93]*.

To invade the cells need an active process that involves cell motility and extracellular matrix proteolysis, and for this reason we monitored the expression of MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase-9, which belongs to MMP family involved in tumor progression, including invasion and cancer metastasis [28]*. Cell invasion ability was assessed in cases 1, 2 and 3 in absence or presence of growth factors (GF). 2:The Notch1 pathway was investigated in more detail in three cases and surprisingly we found that Notch1 target Hes1 protein was not down modulated by Notch inhibition. This finding may be explained by the results of Wall et al.

In tumor cells, FoxO1 is generally considered as a tumor suppressor and upregulation of FoxO1 is beneficial in several types of cancer31–33*. In macrophages, FoxO1 seems to have various functions. 2:In summary, our study shows that FoxO1 regulates anti-tumor effect (including phagocytosis) of macrophages through changing the metabolic hemostasis.
