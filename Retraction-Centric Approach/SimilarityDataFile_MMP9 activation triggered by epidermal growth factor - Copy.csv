NOX1-derived ROS are crucial for the regulation of metastasis through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in non-small lung cancer cells (NSCLC) [84], and it is possible that TLR4 signaling enhances the expression of NOX1 which subsequently regulates MMP-9 and increases metastasis in these cells [84, 85]*. O'Leary described the role of TLR-4-dependent NOX1 activity in accelerating adherence of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated colon cancer cells (SW480, SW620, and CT-26 cell lines) and proposed a mechanism in which TLR-4-mediated activation of NF-κB leads to increased activation of NOX and in consequence to a higher level of ROS and phosphorylation of Akt [86].",Other,NotHarmful,No,1,Oxid Med Cell Longev,2017,6/20/2017,NotRetracted,0.46481034,0.74837583,0.7328247,0.64867029

24705809,27888810,M2 macrophages induce ovarian cancer cell proliferation via a heparin binding epidermal growth factor/matrix metalloproteinase 9 intercellular feedback loop,No,No,"1: Studies investigating MMP expression in ovarian cancer patients determined that MMP-9 expression correlated with the advanced stage of the disease [35], and clinical data suggested that elevated levels of pro-MMP-9 are of prognostic value, independent of residual disease presence [36]. In multiple tumor types, MMP-9 drives cell behaviors such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition [29] and invasion [37]*, primarily through the effects of MMP-9 on degradation of extracellular matrix such as collagen I, II, and IV [38, 39]. Our results showed that inhibition of MMP-9 prevented co-culture induced proliferation; however, addition of activated MMP-9 to tumor cells did not increase proliferation. 2: When MMP9 was knocked down in OVCA433, extended co-culture was unable to induce the expected increase in proliferation, indicating that the induction of MMP9 in the tumor cells was critical. In both normal and tumor cells, MMP-9 has been shown to be secreted in response to EGFR activation via exogenous ligands [29, 37, 45].

Lamin B1 and α-tubulin were used to assure the purity of the fractions as has been applied before [8–11]*. We found that overexpression of miR-21 significantly decreased the ratio of nuclear vs cytoplasmic FoxO1, while inhibition of miR- 21 significantly increased this ratio by quantification (Fig. 3a) and by representative Western blot images (Fig. 3b). 2:To determine whether inhibition of FoxO1 nuclear retention mediated by miR-21 is the direct cause for the increases in cell growth of PDAC, we further transduced the miR-21-overexpressing PANC-1 cells (PD-miR-21) with a sustained nuclear FoxO1 expressing plasmid, as has been previously described [9–11].

MMP-14 is a member of MMP family, and MMP-14 is encoded by a single-copy gene located on chromosome 14 in humans [22].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,6/5/2015,Retracted,,,,
24705809,25596089,Retracted: Insulin-like growth factor 1 promotes growth of gastric cancer by inhibiting foxo1 nuclear retention,No,No,"In the nucleus, FoxO1 directly activates cell-cycle inhibitors, e.g., p27 [9], to inhibit cell growth [8]. Thus, nuclear form of FoxO1 generally has an inhibitory effect on the growth of most types of cells, while presence of FoxO1 in cytosol suggests loss of suppression on cell growth [8, 10–14].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,1/18/2015,Retracted,,,,
