The cytokeratin 5, 6, 14, and 18 IHC that we utilized in this case were not developed or validated for use in avian species, which may explain the lack of immunoreactivity. Based on the 30-y retrospective search of the CAHFS database and published cases, thymomas have been diagnosed in domestic chickens, parrots, a budgerigar, a myna, an owl, a finch, a Java sparrow, a robin, and a duck; thymoma is a rare finding in birds.2,4,6–10,13,16,17*",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,J Vet Diagn Invest,2021,2/2/2021,NotRetracted,0.46164763,0.79035616,0.55460894,0.47663096,0.53701085,0.564050908

23777537,,"The expression pattern of ACTBL2 in thymoma reveals its
potential therapeutic target efficacy",No,No,"Thymoma is a primary mediastinal tumor, a kind of typical cancer with non-neoplastic lymphocytes [1]. It is characterized by differentiation into thymic epithelial cells [2], and also manifests as oppressive symptoms or anterior mediastinal mass [3].

23777537,31967407,Deciphering tissue-based proteome signatures revealed novel subtyping and prognostic markers for thymic epithelial tumors,No,No,"The type A thymoma derives from the central medulla region of thymus and has neoplastic cells with spindle or oval shape, whereas the type B thymomas originate from thymic cortex on the periphery with the presence of immature lymphocytes (Weksler and Lu, 2014). Type AB thymoma is generally regarded to combine features from both type A and type B (Green et al.,2015; Khaki et al., 2013)*. The TC, often occurring in 5–10% of the TET patients (Kelly, 2013; Lamarca et al., 2013; Ried et al., 2016), consists of a variety of diverse tumors, among which thymic squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the most frequently observed (Marx et al., 2014; Moser et al., 2014; Scorsetti et al.,2016; Takahama et al., 2017; Weissferdt et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2016).",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Mol Oncol,2020,1/23/2020,NotRetracted,0.5780078,0.53925425,0.5196901,0.66577256,0.797783,0.620101542

Reduced blood flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) system decreases the amount of venous blood in the right auricle, causing a number of clinical characteristics and symptoms, such as dilated neck veins, oedematous upper limbs, cyanosis, headache, dyspnoea, cough, and dysphagia [3, 4].",Introduction,Recommending,No,1,,,,NotRetracted,0.6425005,0.52406216,0.29404414,0.45343333,0.5581328,0.494434586

can be helpful to differentiate between thymoma and thymic lymphoma by labeling cytokeratins CK14 and CK18, as well as showing positive results for proliferating cell nuclear antigen in cases of thymomas*.5:The World Health Organization nomenclature for human neoplasms seems to be applicable to characterization of thymomas in avian medicine*. 6:However, in review of these 2 cases compared with the case we describe, staging and metastatic behavior of thymomas in birds appears comparable to the classification used in human medicine, as was suggested in a report describing cervical type AB thymoma in a common myna.4,12,14,15*",Discussion,Recommending,No,>1,J Ovarian Res,2014,3/19/2014,Retracted,,,,,,
