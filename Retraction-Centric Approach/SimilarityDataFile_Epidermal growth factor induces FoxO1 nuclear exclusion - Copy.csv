25008564,30272254,Trifluoperazine prevents FOXO1 nuclear excretion and reverses doxorubicin-resistance in the SHG44/DOX drug-resistant glioma cell line,No,No,"For example, FOXO1 makes contact with the p27 promoter, initiates transcription and suppresses cell cycle progression (21). FOXO1 also decreases tumor invasion by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)7, MMP9, vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (22,23)*. However, the inactivation of FOXO1 has been noted to occur in several tumor types (24-26). ",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Int J Mol Med,2018,10/2/2018,NotRetracted,0.5984541,0.8792951,0.7388746
25008564,28774834,Role of Forkhead Box Class O proteins in cancer progression and metastasis,No,No,"Also, Chen et al. suggested that activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream PI3 K/Akt induce FoxO1 nuclear exclusion and MMP9 to promote invasion in A-172 glioblastoma cells [69]. Likewise, Ding et al. also revealed that nuclear exclusion of Akt downstream FoxO1 by EGF-mediated Akt activation enhanced invasiveness via MMP7 activation in Hep-2 larynx carcinoma cells, which was inhibited by EGFR inhibitor AG1478 or by the PI3 K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 [70]*. Taken together, these evidences suggest the metastatic potential of PAX3-FoxO1 oncogene, loss of FoxO1 and activation of CNR1.",Other,NotHarmful,No,1,Semin Cancer Biol,2018,8/5/2017,NotRetracted,0.5325187,0.84184754,0.68718312
25008564,26448177,Loss of FOXO1 promotes gastric tumour growth and metastasis through upregulation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu expression,No,No,"The FOXO1 protein is tightly regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and methylation, and FOXO1 expression is highly variable in different tissues (van der Horst and Burgering, 2007). In human cancers, FOXO1 decreased metastatic potential through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) in larynx cancer cells *(Ding et al, 2014) or MMP9 in lung cancer cells (Pei et al, 2014) and glioblastoma cells (Chen et al, 2014). In contrast, FOXO1 led to an increase in the expression of MMP1 followed by breast cancer cell metastasis (Feng et al, 2011).

25008564,28775781,The Emerging Roles of Forkhead Box (FOX) Proteins in Osteosarcoma,No,No,"Depleted or decreased expression of FOXO1 has been demonstrated in a number of tumors, including breast, pancreatic, prostate, cervical, endometrial and renal cancers [87]. In which, FOXO1 expression can be downregulated by many factors, including miRNAs (miR-9, -27, -96, -153, -182, -183, and -186) [88, 89], estrogen [90] and epidermal growth factor [91]*. FOXO1 participates in the regulation of a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p27KIP1, p21WAF1, p130, cyclin G2, cyclin D1 and D2) [92, 93], and this protein can also regulate the apoptosis mediators Bim, Fas ligand and Bcl-6 [94].",Other,NotHarmful,No,1,J Cancer,2017,8/5/2017,NotRetracted,0.59976584,0.77835023,0.689058035

MMP7 is an important invasion- or metastasis-related NF-κB target gene that is directly associated with the metastatic processes in cancers [2, 4, 24, 25]*.",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2016,11/11/2015,NotRetracted,0.6793066,0.76712036,0.72321348
25008564,25519686,Inhibition of progression of PanIN through antagonizing EGFR,No,No,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) [6–12]. EGFRs are activated after they are bound with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins [6–12]. EGFR signaling is well-known for its involvement in the pathogenesis and progression of different cancers [6–12]. Of note, EGFR signaling has been shown to play a critical role in the pancreatic embryogenesis and postnatal growth [13], as well as in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers [14–19].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,12/19/2014,NotRetracted,0.64814067,0.7612295,0.704685085

Lamin B1 and α-tubulin were used to assure the purity of the fractions as has been applied before [8–11]. We found that overexpression of miR-21 significantly decreased the ratio of nuclear vs cytoplasmic FoxO1, while inhibition of miR-21 significantly increased this ratio by quantification (Fig. 3a) and by representative Western blot images (Fig. 3b).",Result,Harmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,1/28/2015,NotRetracted,0.5762317,0.75475955,0.665495625
25008564,27835585,Transcriptional repression of FOXO1 by KLF4 contributes to glioma progression,No,No,"Decreased FOXO1 expression has been shown in many cancer types, such as Hodgkin lymphoma [7], breast cancer [8] and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma [9]. Furthermore, FOXO1 suppressed the metastatic potential through inhibiting MMP7 in larynx cancer cells [10]* or MMP9 in lung cancer cells [11]. FOXO1 inhibits angiogenesis in gastric cancer via inactivation of the HIF-1α-VEGF pathway [12] and inhibits cell growth, tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [13].

PI3-K/AKT signaling pathway mediated the upregulation of MMP-7 via FoxO1-activating manner in EGFstimulated Hep-2 cells [9]*. Moreover, Shi et al.

25008564,25227664,MiR-143 inhibits EGFR-signaling-dependent osteosarcoma invasion,No,No,"However, correlation of EGFR expression and molecules that control OS metastasis has not been drawn. Some therapies have been developed aiming to interfere with intracellular pathways regulated by EGFR in glioblastoma [12–14], in lung cancer [15], in larynx carcinoma [16]*, and in gastric cancer [17]. Moreover, EGFR as a potential therapy target is further justified by the fact that protein expression in these tumors is associated with significantly higher metastasis.",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2014,9/18/2014,NotRetracted,0.46828666,0.708979,0.58863283
25008564,25596089,Retracted: Insulin-like growth factor 1 promotes growth of gastric cancer by inhibiting foxo1 nuclear retention,No,No,"1:In the nucleus, FoxO1 directly activates cell-cycle inhibitors, e.g., p27 [9], to inhibit cell growth [8]. Thus, nuclear form of FoxO1 generally has an inhibitory effect on the growth of most types of cells, while presence of FoxO1 in cytosol suggests loss of suppression on cell growth [8, 10–14]*. 2:AGS cells were transfected with a constitutively nuclear FoxO1-expressing plasmid, as has been previously described [10, 11, 15]*. The transfected cells were termed as AGSnFoxO1. AGS-nFoxO1 expressed high levels of nuclear FoxO1, which cannot be phosphorylated due to a defect on phosphorylation site. 3:Since nuclear presence of FoxO1 is critical for cell growth inhibition, we thus examined whether IGF-1 may affect cellular location of FoxO1 in GC cells. We found that IGF-1 induced nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 in AGS cells (Fig. 4a), suggesting a possibility of this regulatory axis to be responsible for the IGF-1-induced GC cell growth. To prove it, we transduced the AGS cells with a sustained nuclear FoxO1 expressing plasmid, as has been previously described [10, 11, 15]. The transduced cells were termed as AGS-nFoxO1 cells.",Intro+M&M+Result,Harmful,No,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,1/18/2015,Retracted,,,
