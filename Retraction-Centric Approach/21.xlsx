In our study, we have established a relationship between HBx and Nrdp1. We demonstrated that HBx could decrease the stability of Nrdp1, thereby up-regulating the expression of ErbB3.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2016,2/6/2016,NotRetracted,0.8488978,0.84934676,0.84912228
24867101,26909134,Ubiquitin proteasome system research in gastrointestinal cancer,No,No,"Neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (NRDP1) is significantly decreased in CRC tissues. Knockdown of NRDP1 enhances the proliferation of CRC cells, while the overexpression of NRDP1 inhibits the proliferation of CRC cells. Further analysis shows that NRDP1 may induce the degradation of its target ErbB3 to inhibit the activation of both the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in CRC cells, which seems to affect cell proliferation via the nuclear retention of a major cell­cycle inhibitor, p27. In addition, NRPD1 inhibits the expression of MMP7, which is required for cell invasion[90,91]*.

24867101,26088461,Nrdp1-mediated ErbB3 degradation inhibits glioma cell migration and invasion by reducing cytoplasmic localization of p27(Kip1),No,No,"RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1 (Nrdp1) is known to associate with ErbB3 in an activation-independent manner [12]. Nrdp1 has been shown to mediate the degradation of ErbB3, and loss of Nrdp1 may lead to ErbB3 overexpression and cancer progression [7, 13]. We have demonstrated that Nrdp1 expression is relatively lower in human glioma tissues, which contributes to glioma progression by up-regulating baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat repeatcontaining ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE), an inhibitory apoptosis protein [14].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,J Neurooncol,2015,6/20/2015,NotRetracted,0.80148137,0.82319057,0.81233597
24867101,30523157,Functional genomic characterization of a synthetic anti-HER3 antibody reveals a role for ubiquitination by RNF41 in the anti-proliferative response,No,No,"1: Because RNF41 shRNAs attenuated the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95, we tested whether they also attenuated the effects of IgG 95 on the ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3. In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells Because RNF41 shRNAs attenuated the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95, we tested whether they also attenuated the effects of IgG 95 on the ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3. In SKBR3 cells expressing shRNAs targeting RNF41 or control proteins (RFP or luciferase), we assessed HER3 levels after treatment with a negative control IgG or IgG 95. In the presence of the negative control IgG, cells expressing RNF41 shRNA exhibited higher HER3 levels than those expressing control shRNAs (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with previous reports (45, 46)* and with on-target shRNA activity. Moreover, down-regulation of HER3 levels was attenuated in cells. 2: In summary, our data highlight a functional contribution of RNF41 to the anti-proliferative activity of IgG 95 in SKBR3 cells and support a dual role for this E3 ligase in the regulation of HER3. First, as also described previously (44, 45, 47)*, RNF41 regulates resting HER3 levels, as knockdown of RNF41 results in an increase in total HER3. 3: In HER2-amplifiedSKBR3cells,RNF41playsthedualroleof controlling both total HER3 levels and antibody-mediated degradation. We predict that these two functions may render RNF41-depleted cancer cell lines more aggressive as a result of higherHER3levels,asseenelsewhere(45,46),andlesssensitive to antibodies like IgG 95 that depend on RNF41 for their efficacy, especially in the context of HER2 amplification where HER3signalingisdriveninaligand-independentmanner.Conversely, given that RNF41 knockdown increases the proliferative response to NRG1 (46), cancers exhibiting low RNF41 and ligand-dependent signaling would likely respond to NRG1 competitive anti-HER3 antibodies. 5: Based on our observations that IgG 95 induces ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3, we furthered explored the mechanism of IgG 95 function by performing a UPS-targeted functional genomic screen and found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 is at least partially responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of IgG 95. Previous studies have found that overexpression of RNF41 leads to ubiquitination and down-regulation of HER3 (44 –47) and that NRG1 promotes RNF41-mediated HER3 ubiquitination (58).","Discussion, Other",Harmful,Yes,>1,J Biol Chem,2019,12/8/2018,NotRetracted,0.7524531,0.8121402,0.78229665
24867101,27446249,Nrdp1-mediated degradation of BRUCE decreases cell viability and induces apoptosis in human 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells,No,No,"Nrdp1 was originally found to be involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ErbB3), a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family (9). In the past decades, Nrdp1-mediated degradation of ErbB3 has been shown to be correlated with a number of diseases, such as human breast and colorectal cancers (10,11)*. Furthermore, Nrdp1 is also implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of two other E3 ubiquitin ligases, namely baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR)-containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (BRUCE) (an apoptosis inhibitor) and parkin, which is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (12,13).",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Exp Ther Med,2016,7/23/2016,NotRetracted,0.6693214,0.78221923,0.725770315
24867101,26464195,"The retinoic acid derivative, ABPN, inhibits pancreatic cancer through induction of Nrdp1",No,No,"In our study, we have found that ABPN treatment led to strong induction of cell death as well as G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 3A, available at Carcinogenesis Online and Table 1). Because ErbB3, EGFR and Nrdp1 have been implicated in the regulation of survival and cell cycle progression (37–40), the effect of ABPN on these proteins likely induced a significant impact on cell cycle transition and survival. Further studies will be required to determine the precise cellular mechanisms affected by ABPN treatment.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Carcinogenesis,2015,10/15/2015,NotRetracted,0.6481067,0.7739575,0.7110321
24867101,30154664,Reduced expression of Nrdp1 predicts a poor prognosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma,No,No,"As a putative tumor suppressor, Nrdp1 has been found to participate in the progression of several types of cancers, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer.16,22,23* Nrdp1 was assumed to negatively regulate the cell-surface expression of ErbB3, thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and invasion.

24867101,27353365,The ER structural protein Rtn4A stabilizes and enhances signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB3,No,No," In addition to ErbB3 and ErbB4 (12, 61), Nrdp1 has been reported to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of a diverse array of proteins involved in cellular regulation, including several type 1 cytokine receptors (62–64), the Toll-like receptor signaling adapter protein MyD88 (65), the inhibitor of apoptosis domain–containing protein BRUCE (66), the nuclear factors retinoic acid receptor (62) and C/EBPb (67), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin (68). Moreover, as a regulator of the stability of key signaling proteins, Nrdp1 could play roles in the onset or progression of various disease states that involve ER and cellular stresses, including breast cancer (38, 69, 70), prostate cancer (60, 71), colorectal cancer (72–74), glioblastoma (75, 76), cardiac disease (77, 78), Parkinson’s disease (68), and diabetes (59, 79)*. Thus, further exploration could uncover roles for the Rtn4A–Nrdp1 axis in many disease states.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,Sci Signal,2016,6/30/2016,NotRetracted,0.50969374,0.6373211,0.57350742
24867101,25926384,Retracted: MiR-497 promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer cells through Nrdp1 inhibition,No,No,"In line with this specific function of Nrdp1, loss of Nrdp1 may lead to overexpression of ErbB3-associated diseases [5]. Recently, Nrdp1 was found to downregulate in CRC specimen, and Nrdp1 seems to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [6]*.Moreover, in our previous report [7], we have confirmed that the levels of Nrdp1 significantly decreased in CRC.",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,Tumour Biol,2015,5/1/2015,Retracted,,,
24867101,25330950,Retracted: Nrdp1 inhibits metastasis of colorectal cancer cells by EGFR signaling-dependent MMP7 modulation,No,No,"1: Nrdp1 has been shown to mediate the degradation of ErbB3, and a loss of Nrdp1 may lead to receptor overexpression and disease progression [17]. Recently, Nrdp1 has been shown to downregulate in CRC and appears to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*. However, whether Nrdp1 may also regulate cell invasion in CRC has not been studied before. 2: To figure out the relationship of Nrdp1 and MMP7 levels in CRC, we performed a correlation test in 20 CRC patients. A strong negative correlation was detected (Fig. 1c, =−0.82, p<0.001), suggesting the possibility of a regulation pathway between Nrdp1 and MMP7. Since Nrdp1 mediates the degradation of ErbB3 to antagonize EGFR signaling [17] and since Nrdp1 has recently been shown to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*, we thus hypothesize that Nrdp1 may inhibit MMP7 through its regulation on EGFR signaling. We were thus prompted to examine this hypothesis. 3: Nrdp1 has been showntomediatethedegradationofErbB3,andlossofNrdp1 may lead to ErbB3 overexpression and, thus, activation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Interestingly, Nrdp1 has recently been shown to decrease in CRC and to inhibit CRC cell growth through p27 [18]*. Nevertheless, whether Nrdp1 plays a role in the control of CRC metastasis has not been examined. 4: Of note, a recent publication has reached similar results with us [18], but it focuses on the inhibitory role of Nrdp1 on CRC cell growth. It is not surprising that here we found that Nrdp1 also has an inhibitory role on CRC invasion, since both share the same signaling pathway, ERK/MAPK, which regulates multiple cellular events relating to cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis.","Introduction, Result, Discussion",Harmful,Yes,>1,Tumour Biol,2015,10/22/2014,Retracted,,,
