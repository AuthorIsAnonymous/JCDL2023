18234298,21472266,Synergistic anti-neoplastic effect of AG1478 in combination with cisplatin or paclitaxel on human endometrial and ovarian cancer cells,Yes,No,"1:normal endometrial epithelial cells were separated from stromal cells by digestion of the tissue fragments with collagenase, as described previously (12)*. 2:The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry after 3 days of culturing as previously described (12)*. cells (5x104) were exposed to aG1478, cisplatin or paclitaxel in 6-well flat-bottomed plates for 72 h. 3:cells were prepared for FacS as described above and stained using the Mitocapture Apoptosis Detection kit (Biovision; Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a fluorescent lipophilic cationic reagent that assesses mitochondrial membrane permeability.

18234298,26788147,β-hydroxyisovaleryl-shikonin induces human cervical cancer cell apoptosis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling,No,No,"Natural shikonin-like compounds and the derivatives of these compounds demonstrate cytotoxic actions and antitumor effects. β-HIVS is a shikonin derivative that suppresses tumor cell proliferation and induces tumor cell apoptosis (28,29)*. Hashimoto et al (30) confirmed that β-HIVS exerts cytotoxic effects on numerous types of human carcinoma cell lines. When 10-6 M β-HIVS was used to treat HL-60 cells for 3 h, typical apoptotic characteristics were observed in the cells, including morphological changes, nuclear fragmentation, DNA ladder formation and caspase-3 activation, which indicates that β-HIVS induced tumor cell apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent mechanism. Previous studies (28,31)* verified that β-HIVS exerted inhibitory and proapoptotic effects on endometrial cancer, chorionic carcinoma and ovarian cancer cells, with IC50 values ranging between 10-6 and 10-8 M.",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,>1,Oncol Lett,2015,1/21/2016,NotRetracted,0.5174632,0.659816,0.5886396,
18234298,20883187,Natural products derived from traditional chinese medicine as novel inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor,No,No,"Shikonin, the parent compound of betahydroxyisovalerylshikonin (beta-HIVS), isolated from Lithospermum radix, are ATP non-competitive inhibitors of EGFR. They induce apoptosis in human endometrial and ovarian cancer cells. The action of beta-HIVS, as well as that of shikonin, involves the inhibition of PTK, and they also suggest the possibility of producing a novel group of PTK inhibitors based on shikonin as the parent compound [58, 59]*.",Other,NotHarmful,No,1,Comb Chem High Throughput Screen,2010,10/2/2010,NotRetracted,0.40693823,0.55864954,0.482793885,
18234298,,"β-Hydroxyisovaleryl shikonin promotes reactive oxygen species production in HCT116 colon cancer cells, leading to caspase-mediated apoptosis",No,No,"Previous reports showed that HIVS promoted apoptosis in different cancer cells, including human leukemia cells (Hashimoto et al., 1999; Masuda et al., 2003), lung cancer cells (Hashimoto et al., 2002), and endometrial and ovarian cancer cells (Takai et al., 2008)*. Moreover, HIVS markedly diminished the growth of U937 human lymphoma cells, VMRC-MELG malignant melanoma cells, COLO320DM colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, AZ-521 gastric ancer cells, and MIA Paca-2 pancreatic cancer cells (Hashimoto et al., 1999).",Discussion,NotHarmful,No,1,,2018,,NotRetracted,0.4399143,0.5510119,0.4954631,
18234298,21689869,Synthesis and antitumour activity of β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin analogues,,No,"Synthetic shikonin derivatives have attracted so much attention, and likewise natural shikonin derivatives also evoked the researchers’ interest. b-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (b-HIVS, 2, Fig. 1), a naturally occurring derivative of shikonin, efficiently inhibits the growth of various lines of tumour cells such as leukaemia [8e10], lung cancer [11,12], endometrial cancer [13]*, ovarian cancer [13]*, and prostate cancer [14]. Moreover some research findings indicate that the effects of b-HIVS on cancer cell lines are much stronger than normal cell lines [13,14]*. Accumulating evidence indicates that b-HIVS selectively inhibits specific tumours, e.g. lung cancer and leukaemia; compared to extensive cytotoxicity of shikonin [8,12,15].

18234298,22834677,Shikonin and its derivatives: a patent review,No,No,"Shikonin derivatives have shown potent antitumor efficacy as tyrosine kinase inhibitors [68]. In a study, b-HIVs was shown as an ATP non-competitive inhibitor of PTKs and exerted its antitumor activity with higher sensitivity of cancer cells compared with normal healthy cells [69]*. Masuda et al.

18234298,,Beta-Hydroxyisovalerylshikonin Inhibits the Growth of U266 Multiple Myeloma Cells by Triggering the Mitochondrial Pathway,No,No,"Currently, a series of novel shikonin derivative analogues bearing oxygen-containing substituents were designed, synthesized or isolated [6-8], among which, beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (beta-HIVS) has been highlighted for the strongest apoptosis-inducing activity among various derivatives of shikonin. This drug is an ATP non competitive inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases and is capable of inducing apoptosis in various human tumor cell lines which has been documented by several publications [9-13]*. It is also reported that betaHIVS shows great promise as a potent apoptosis-inducing agent in the treatment of hematological malignancies included leukemia, although this still retains in research and development stages [14-16].",Introduction,NotHarmful,No,1,,2014,,NotRetracted,0.3910185,0.4869882,0.43900335,
